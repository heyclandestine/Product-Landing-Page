This is  a mock product landing page.

I decided to go with a computer parts and pre-built seller.

One issue I couldn't figure out was why the parts and pre-built section would indent when you clicked their tab in the navbar. It's only a test, so I didn't mind working on it too much, so I just moved on. 

There were many things that I did lazily in the end, just to get it out and move on to the final project for the freeCodeCamp certification.
